# Colleen's Leadership README/Operating Manual
I aspire to be the best stand up, hard-working, ever-learning executive who won't shy away from rolling up her sleeves and getting my hands dirty when needed, or working on problems no one else wants to solve. Building great (and profitable) products is about a continuous commitment to excellence (both internally and externally). I lead, guide, and coach my teams to become obsessive students of their customers, their business, and technology, world-class collaborators, and high impact contributors.

Be excellent to yourself, and one another.

## My Leadership Philosophy
* Be a respectful human being first and foremost
* Pursue excellence in your craft to the best of your abilities. Let that pursuit of excellence drive you. Compete with yourself, not others
* Show intellectual curiosity / effort before asking for help
* Model proactive sharing and being generous with context, information and knowledge (managing up/across)
* Outcomes > how
* Work hard and be nice to people - Pay it forward, and assume benevolence
* You own your career, but you rent your title. Manage it well
* The right job and culture should not mandate that you sacrifice your health, happiness, and family for your paycheck
* Action breeds clarity. Start by starting. Exposure therapy works

## My Daily/Weekly Cadence
TOPIC | ANSWER
----- | -----
Most Productive Time of the Day | Mornings; before Noon 
Key 1:1s* | Directs - 1x week, Skips - 1x month, Peers - bi-weekly, Org - monthly all hands, 
Worst Day/Time for an intense 2 hr meeting | Fridays; After 3PM
Craft / networking / connection | 1x month I like to block mornings for coffee meetings, networking, and connection with the broader product/fintech community to keep my network and skills strong. Additionally, once every 6 weeks I meet with my Chief core group, meeting my Product Peers 1/month. I also like to attend 1-2 conferences per year related to product and leadership
Personal reflection and growth | I like to take a personal retreat once per year (usually solo) to reflect on my personal and professional goals and recharge.

*and as needed, always

## My Communication Channels
* My time (and thus my calendar) is very important to me. I strive to be an efficient person & purposefully carve out time in my day/week to 'think' and learn (I learn through doing and writing)
* Please don’t double book me. My calendar is public and open. If the calendar slot is open, take it (an agenda is requested)
* Please do share an agenda & any background reading/context with the invite. If there's no agenda, I'm more likely to decline. Your time is valuable and so is mine.
* I send messages when it's most convenient for me. Sometimes this means at night vs end of day, after my son goes to sleep. When I do this, know that I do not expect an off-hours response unless its an explicit ask. I do my best to caveat  post-work messages with a <not urgent> or <for tomorrow> (though I am not perfect).
* I do my best to not ping/message folks over the weekend unless they've reached out first.
* As we norm as a team, I prefer cameras to be on. Same in larger group meetings. As we work together though, Im very open to walking meetings so we both can get some fresh air and catch up via phone for 1:1s (so long as a screen is not needed)

Reach out to me in whichever medium you'd like (but I do often have my notifications on silent). I strive for a 24-hr SLA. If it's crazy urgent, don't hesitate to text me or call my phone.

## My expectations of folks who report to me
* Please set up a healthy system of push/pull of sharing information (over-communicate). I can always handle bad news, but I hate surprises. You are not letting me down by communicating risks, and concerns. I will support you in solving them.
* Please take ownership of your career and personal/professional development - you have the freedom and responsibility to decide your career goals. I have a responsibility to create clarity and offer you support in achieving them. That said, I cannot tell you what those goals are.
* Please tell me if anything feels off, as soon as you feel it.
* I work some weekends; this is my choice. I do not expect you to work weekends, but I do expect you to work hard during the week.
* Please remember that regardless of your level or if you manage people or not, you are in a leadership role. I expect you to model our culture and values not only in the value and outcomes you create for the business, but in how you do it on our team. 

## What you can expect of me as your manager
* Someone who will fight with and for you to achieve outsized professional growth & development
* Someone who won't micromanage you, but expects much of you
* Someone invested in owning the outcomes our team has signed up for, and is invested and interested in how our team generates them
* Someone who cares less about facetime/hrs worked as much as the quality & impact of your output
* Someone who over-indexes on transparency. Sure, there will be some things I just can't share with you, but I will never lie to you. 
* Someone who truly cares about you personally and professionally and wants to see you happy and successful in work and life. While I am not responsible for that, I will do all I can to support it

## How I practice Product - Resources/Approaches that inform my practice:
There are amazing resources available written by people much smarter than me. It is my priority, as a practioner of the craft, to constantly be elevating how I practice product and adding new tools to my toolbelt.

My Product Resource Stack can be found on my Substack, Coffee with Colleen

## My energy creators
* Shipping software and watching the usage data come in
* Solving a challenging technical, analytical, or strategic problem
* Telling stories with data, and diving into quantitative insights
* Learning something new (I learn with my hands)
* Mentorship & connection (bi-directional)
* Talking with users (discovery)
* Creating - of all kinds - a piece of art, a great meal, a product or project, or a piece of writing all give me energy
* Teaching new skills to others; building my own skills based on the knowledge and experience of others
* Seeing my team members hit a personal or professional goal
* Connecting company strategy and vision with product strategy, vision, and everyday work

## My energy destroyers
* We/They language
* Office politics & gossip (competing with your co-workings, blaming others etc)
* Meetings where the outcomes are unclear and there is no one driving the agenda or conversation
* Avoiding or delaying uncomfortable and/or important conversations

## My Superpowers
* Knowing what to ignore
* Hiring & org design
* Traversing across an org (balancing functional and business context); balancing detailed knowledge and understanding of key decisions with top line TL;DR
* Setting vision and strategic context for my teams
* Coaching craft

## My achilles heels (always WIP)
* A large part of why I am hired is to help companies of all sizes remember that they can operate like a startup. Therefore, I often favor the most efficient path to impact (the solution that gives us 90% of the benefit at 30% of the cost and gets us into testing with real users sooner). It does not mean I do not see the details or value in the 100% solution (or that I am lazy or apathetic to quality work), but call me out if you feel as though I am not seeing the full picture or dismissing concerns.
* I learned (the hard way) earlier in my career to pick my battles, and learned that while important, not all problems have the same priority or urgency. Please call me out if I am missing context on a situation or challenge, or if you ever feel dismissed or not heard. While we can disagree on approach and urgency, it is important to me that you always feel heard.
* Short in written communication - I tend to be to-the-point and short in written comms, which can come across as curt. It is not intentional, nor am I irritated that you are reaching out to me. It's just my style, and much of it comes from overcorrecting feedback that I was being too verbose.
* I have a strong voice, however my opinions are strong opinions, loosely held. Rarely will you find that I cannot be moved from a position (tip: quantitative data and logic are my love language). Nevertheless, I strive for balancing inquiry and advocacy.
* Creating context - when I am short on time, my communication suffers. This impacts my team, especially my senior leaders who rely on me to provide them the strategic context needed to make good decisions. This is my fault and is something I continuously work on.

## What interests do you have when you're not working?
* Outdoor adventures - The longer I work in tech the more I relish in time outdoors. Walking, hiking, and the occasional slow jog are a great way to get around the city, and explore. Every weekend, my husband (who also works in the internet), son and I find a park we want to check out, walk there, and pick up coffee (and muffins for the little guy, and sometimes mom) along the way.
* Connection & community - there are few things I love more than good conversation with great people. Even better if it involves good food, drinks, and a bonfire and/or music.
* Reading - I love fiction (romance, thriller, and some fantasy), and self development.
* Travel (though this has not been a top priority with a toddler)
* Art - my first job was an assistant art teacher. To this day, blending colors, and painting is one of my favorite ways to destress and express myself creatively. My son and I do a lot of art projects together on weekends, it's our thing.

## Other "Stuff"
* I'm a former stutterer...sometimes I still get tongue-tied when I get scared, excited, nervous, or emotional
* I grew up fairly shy. To break myself of that habit I went to college knowing no one. And then studied abroad in a country where I barely spoke the language. Those were two of the best decisions of my life.
* I got married at 28. Decided I wanted children at 36 (so did my husband). Gave birth to my son a few months shy of 40. I have spent most of my adult life without children. It is hands-down the most rewarding, joyful, amazing, exhausting and hardest role I will ever play; I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have children. I also am equally familiar with the pain and heartbreak associated with trying to build a family. This experience has changed who I am as a person, both within work and outside of work. If you are one of the [1 in 6 families experiencing these challenges](https://www.cofertility.com/family-learn/fertility-statistics), my heart goes out to you, and am happy to support you in any way.
