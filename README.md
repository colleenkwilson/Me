# Colleen's Leadership README/Operating Manual
I aspire to be the best stand up, hard-working, ever-learning technology executive who won't shy away from rolling up the sleves and getting my hands dirty when needed, or working on problems no one else wants to solve. Building great (and profitable) products and experiences are about becoming an obsessive student of your customers'/market's pains and aspirations. I lead, guide, and coach my teams to become obsessive students of their customers.
