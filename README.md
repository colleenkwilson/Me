# Colleen's Leadership README/Operating Manual
I strive to be a hardworking, ever-learning executive who isn’t afraid to roll up my sleeves and tackle tough challenges. For me, building great (and profitable) products is about a continuous commitment to excellence, both internally and externally. I lead, guide, and coach my teams to become deeply curious about their customers, their business, and technology while fostering a culture of collaboration and high-impact contribution.

Be excellent to yourself, and to one another.

## My Leadership Philosophy
* Be a respectful human first and foremost.
* Pursue excellence in your craft to the best of your abilities. Let the pursuit of excellence drive you. Compete with yourself, not others.
* Show intellectual curiosity and effort before asking for help.
* Proactively share context, information, and knowledge – manage up and across generously.
* Outcomes > how.
* Work hard and be kind – pay it forward, and always assume good intentions.
* You own your career, but rent your title. Manage it with care.
* The right job and culture should never require sacrificing your health, happiness, or family for a paycheck.
* Action breeds clarity – start by starting. Exposure therapy works.

## My Communication Channels
* My time is valuable, and so is yours. I purposefully carve out time in my week to think and learn.
* Please don't double book me. My calendar is public – if the slot is open, feel free to book it, but an agenda is requested.
* Share any context and background reading with the invite. No agenda? I may decline.
* I send messages when it’s convenient for me, which sometimes means late evenings after my son is asleep. I don't expect off-hours responses unless explicitly stated. I try to caveat messages with a "for tomorrow" or "not urgent" but like all people, I'm not always consistent.
* I aim not to send weekend messages unless it’s urgent or you’ve reached out first.
* As we normalize as a team, I prefer cameras on during meetings; beyond that, I'm open to walking 1:1s over the phone when no screen is needed (can't we all use some more vitamin D and fresh air?)
* You can reach out to me in any medium you prefer, but I often have notifications on silent. If it’s urgent, please text or call. I strive for a 24 hour SLA

## My expectations of folks who report to me
* Please set up a healthy system of push/pull of sharing information (over-communicate). I can always handle bad news, but I hate surprises. You are not letting me down by communicating risks, and concerns. I will support you in solving them.
* Please take ownership of your career and personal/professional development - you have the freedom and responsibility to decide your career goals. I have a responsibility to create clarity and offer you support in achieving them. That said, I cannot tell you what those goals are.
* Please tell me if anything feels off, as soon as you feel it.
* I may work weekends, but that’s my choice. I don’t expect you to, but I do expect hard work during the week.
* You are in a leadership role, regardless of your title or whether you manage people in Namely. Please model our culture and values in both outcomes and how you achieve them.

## What you can expect of me as your manager
* Someone who will fight with and for you to achieve outsized professional growth & development.
* Someone who won't micromanage you, but expects much of you.
* Someone invested in owning the outcomes our team has signed up for, as well as how we acheive them.
* Someone who cares less about facetime/hrs worked as much as the quality & impact of your output.
* Someone who over-indexes on transparency. While I may not be able to share everything, I’ll never lie to you.
* Someone who genuinely cares about your happiness and success. While I am not responsible for that, I will do all I can to support it.

## How I practice Product - Resources/Approaches that inform my practice:
There are amazing resources available written by people much smarter than me. It is my priority, as a practioner of the craft, to constantly be elevating how I practice product and adding new tools to my toolbelt.

My Product Resource Stack can be found on my Substack, Coffee with Colleen

## My energy creators
* Shipping software and watching the usage data come in
* Solving a challenging technical, analytical, or strategic problem
* Telling stories with data, and diving into quantitative insights
* Learning something new (I learn with my hands)
* Mentorship & connection (bi-directional)
* Talking with users (discovery)
* Creating - of all kinds - a piece of art, a great meal, a product or project, or a piece of writing all give me energy
* Teaching new skills to others; building my own skills based on the knowledge and experience of others
* Seeing my team members hit a personal or professional goal
* Connecting company strategy and vision with product strategy, vision, and everyday work

## My energy destroyers
* We/They language
* Office politics & gossip (competing with your co-workings, blaming others etc)
* Meetings where the outcomes are unclear and there is no one driving the agenda or conversation
* Avoiding or delaying uncomfortable and/or important conversations

## My Superpowers
* Knowing what to ignore.
* Hiring and organizational design.
* Balancing the details with the bigger picture (macro vs micro, as well as cross-functionally).
* Setting vision and strategic context.
* Coaching product craft.

## My achilles heels (always WIP)
* A large part of why I am hired is to help companies of all sizes remember that they can operate like a startup. Therefore, I often favor the most efficient path to impact (the solution that gives us 90% of the benefit at 30% of the cost and gets us into testing with real users sooner). If you feel I’m missing important details, call me out.
* I learned (the hard way) earlier in my career to pick my battles, and that while important, not all problems have the same urgency. Please call me out if I am missing context or do not fully grok the issue. While we can disagree on approach and urgency, you should always feel heard.
* I tend to be to-the-point and short in written comms, which can come across as short. It is not intentional, and I am never irritated that you are reaching out to me. It's just my style, and much of it comes from overcorrecting past feedback about being verbose.
* Strong opinions, loosely held – data and logic are my love language, but I always strive to balance inquiry with advocacy. Rarely will you find that I cannot be moved from a position.

## What interests do you have when you're not working?
* Outdoor Adventures – My weekends are for family walks, hikes, and exploring parks with coffee in hand.
* Connection & Community – I love great conversations over good food, drinks, and music.
* Reading – From thrillers to self-development, books are my escape.
* Art – Painting helps me destress and express creativity. My son and I often work on art projects together.

## Other "Stuff"
* I'm a former stutterer...sometimes I still get tongue-tied when I get scared, excited, nervous, or emotional
* I grew up fairly shy. To break myself of that habit I went to college knowing no one. And then studied abroad in a country where I barely spoke the language. Those were two of the best decisions of my life.
* I got married at 28. Decided I wanted children at 36 (so did my husband..phew). Gave birth to my son a few months shy of 40. I have spent most of my adult life without children. It is hands-down the most rewarding, joyful, amazing, exhausting and hardest role I will ever play; I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have children. I also am equally familiar with the pain and heartbreak associated with trying to build a family. This experience has changed who I am as a person, both within work and outside of work. If you are one of the [1 in 6 families experiencing these challenges](https://www.cofertility.com/family-learn/fertility-statistics), my heart goes out to you, and am happy to support you in any way.
