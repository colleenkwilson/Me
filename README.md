# Colleen's Leadership README/Operating Manual
I aspire to be the best stand up, hard-working, ever-learning technology executive who won't shy away from rolling up the sleves and getting my hands dirty when needed, or working on problems no one else wants to solve. Building great (and profitable) products and experiences are about becoming an obsessive student of your customers'/market's pains and aspirations. I lead, guide, and coach my teams to become obsessive students of their customers.

## My Leadership Philosphy
* Try to live by [Principles of Marine Core Leadership](https://www.mcjrotc.marines.mil/About/Leadership-Principles/)
* Show [intellectual curiosity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspremuzic/2017/03/06/what-happens-when-leaders-lack-curiosity/#3cd906236b74)/effort before asking for help 
* Proactive sharing (managing up/across)
* Outcomes > how
* Pay it forward

## My Daily/Weekly Cadence
TOPIC | ANSWER
----- | -----
Most Productive Time of the Day | Mornings; before Noon
Thinking (Low Meeting Days) | Tuesday & Wednesday
1x1 Days | Monday & Friday
Worst Day/Time for an intense 2 hr meeting | Fridays; After 2PM (unless there are cocktails and snacks)

## My Communication Channels
*  My time (and thus my calendar) is very important to me. I strive to be an efficient person & purposefully carve out time in my day/week to 'think'. 
* I'm a morning person so can send communications at ridiculous hours of the morning. I don't expect a response.
* Please DON'T double book me. My calendar is public and open. If the calendar slot is open, take it (an agenda is required...see next)!
* Please DO share an agenda & any background reading/context with the invite. If there's no agenda, I'll likely decline.
* I do my best to not ping/message folks over the weekend unless they've reached out first.

Hit me up in whatever medium you'd like (but I do have ALL my notifications on silent). I strive for a 24-hr SLA. If it's crazy urgent, don't hesitate to double-ring me on the phone

## My expectations of folks who report to me
* Please setup a healthly system of push/pull of sharing information (over-communicate). I can always handle bad news, but I HATE surprises.
* Please take ownership of you career and personal/professional development. If I have to be pushing you often, we won't last long.
* Please tell me if anything feels off, as soon as you feel it.
* I work some weekends; this is my choice. I do NOT expect you to work weekends, but I do expect you to 'crank' during the week.

## What you can expect of me as your manager
* Someone who will fight with and for you to acheive outsized professional growth & development
* Someone who won't micro-manage you, but expects much of you
* Someone who cares less about facetime/hrs worked as much as the quality & impact of your output
* Someone who over-indexes on transparency. Sure, there will be some things I just can't share with you, but I will never lie to you. 

## My energy creators

## My achilles heels (but actively working on em)

* Heart on my sleeve. Call me out in the moment if I seem too intense

* Exploring the world with my husband Andrew (aka Big Fun) ((who is much cooler than I am))...trying to get to Africa, China and back to Spain soon
