# Colleen's Leadership README/Operating Manual
I aspire to be the best stand up, hard-working, ever-learning technology executive who won't shy away from rolling up her sleeves and getting my hands dirty when needed, or working on problems no one else wants to solve. Building great (and profitable) products and experiences are about becoming an obsessive student of your customers'/market's pains and aspirations. I lead, guide, and coach my teams to become obsessive students of their customers.

Let's do big things!

## My Leadership Philosphy
* Be a respectful human first and foremost
* Show [intellectual curiosity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspremuzic/2017/03/06/what-happens-when-leaders-lack-curiosity/#3cd906236b74)/effort before asking for help 
* Proactive sharing (managing up/across)
* Outcomes > how
* Pay it forward

## My Daily/Weekly Cadence
TOPIC | ANSWER
----- | -----
Most Productive Time of the Day | Mornings; before Noon (happy to meet outside of work hours, just ask)
Thinking (Low Meeting Days) | Tuesday & Wednesday
Executive development | Friday PM
1x1 Days | Monday & Thursday (PM)
Worst Day/Time for an intense 2 hr meeting | Fridays; After 3PM

## My Communication Channels
*  My time (and thus my calendar) is very important to me. I strive to be an efficient person & purposefully carve out time in my day/week to 'think'. 
* I'm a morning person so can send communications at ridiculous hours of the morning. I don't expect a response.
* Please DON'T double book me. My calendar is public and open. If the calendar slot is open, take it (an agenda is requested...see next)!
* Please DO share an agenda & any background reading/context with the invite. If there's no agenda, I'm more likely to decline. Your time is valuable and so is mine. Let's do big things.
* I do my best to not ping/message folks over the weekend unless they've reached out first.

Hit me up in whatever medium you'd like (but I do often have my notifications on silent). I strive for a 24-hr SLA. If it's crazy urgent, don't hesitate to double-ring me on the phone or text me

## My expectations of folks who report to me
* Please setup a healthy system of push/pull of sharing information (over-communicate). I can always handle bad news, but I HATE surprises.
* Please take ownership of you career and personal/professional development. If I have to be pushing you often, we won't last long, but I am ALWAYS here to help make it happen.
* Please tell me if anything feels off, as soon as you feel it.
* I work some weekends; this is my choice. I do NOT expect you to work weekends, but I do expect you to 'crank' during the week.

## What you can expect of me as your manager
* Someone who will fight with and for you to achieve outsized professional growth & development
* Someone who won't micro-manage you, but expects much of you
* Someone who cares less about facetime/hrs worked as much as the quality & impact of your output
* Someone who over-indexes on transparency. Sure, there will be some things I just can't share with you, but I will never lie to you. 
* Someone who truly cares about you personally and professionally - I derive a great deal of fulfillment from leading others and its something I truly love and enjoy (and continuously strive to be better at)

## My energy creators
* Fixing/helping/problem-solving
* Love telling stories and deeply understanding our customers
* Lifelong learner (see goals above)
* Mentorship (bi-directional)
* Talking with users (discovery)

## My achilles heels (but actively working on em)
* Short patience at times. Call me out in the moment if you see pursed lips
* Heart on my sleeve. Call me out in the moment if I seem too intense (tip: I don't blink when I am seeing red...thats the time to step in)
* Potty Mouth - sometimes my "sass" and lack of filter is a bit too much and needs to be checked, as does my language
* When I am under stress, I tend to dive into details. This can feel like meddling and micromanaging. Please know this never has anything to do with you or your abilities. Usually its because I want to contribute, or I looking for something to control (this is true especially when I am dealing with personal stress). When this happens, call me out directly, and kindly. The feedback is always helpful

## What interests do you have when you're not working?
* Exploring the world with my husband Andrew...trying to get to Africa, China and back to Spain soon
* Hosting friends at our house - we are the house you go to if bored, hungry, happy or sad, or just want to hang out...and we love it. We have a "doors always open policy"...its something I was raised with and love about our life. We try to bring people together at our house at least 1x month
* Being an exceptional friend, sister, daughter to my family and wife/partner to AW
* Facetiming with my nieces and nephews, and Harper Henrichs (but she's really just in it to talk to Andrew)
* My first job was an assistant art teacher...to this day painting and blending colors is one of my favorite ways to relax and be creative
* Learning - I genuinely love learning new things...you can find me listening to podcasts, books, self-development resources, and YouTube videos regularly (if you have recommendations please send my way)...next goal: Fluency in Spanish

## Other "Stuff"
* Im a former studderer...sometimes I still get tounge-tied when I get scared, excited, nervous, or emotional
* I grew up fairly shy. To break myself of that habit I went to college knowing no one. And then studied aboard in a country that I barely spoke the language. Those were two of the best decisions of my life.
